# Yashima's Advent of Code Solutions

For the past few years I have returned to coding as a hobby, it took only 25 years or so to get it back to being fun.
Advent of Code has played a huge role in that. 

I can't wait for the next December 1st: https://adventofcode.com/

I am mostly coding in java though I have dabbled in python recently. 
So my solutions will be written in java.

## Repo Setup

The repository is set up like this:
* main branch contains my utility classes and a template to start the new year with
* for each year that I have participated I have created a branch called advent-YYYY that contains the "release" of my solutions as far as I got
* changes to the utility files will be cherry-picked back to main.

I realize this is probably an unusual structure but it is the best I could come up with that allows me to easily share my 
utility classes with myself each year and develop them "inline" with the solutions. I am not keen on writing a library for that.
